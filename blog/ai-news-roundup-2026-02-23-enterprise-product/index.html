  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>OpenAI made its most explicit enterprise bet yet, signing multi-year deployment partnerships with Boston Consulting Group, McKinsey &amp; Co., Accenture, and Capgemini under a new program called the OpenAI Frontier Alliance — a clear signal that the market is shifting from "AI pilots" to "AI implementation services." Meanwhile, agentic AI security risk is crystallizing: a new industry report documents real MCP supply chain attacks (fake npm packages, tool poisoning), and Samsung's Galaxy AI platform is becoming a live example of multi-agent orchestration at consumer scale. The policy environment is fragmenting: U.S. state AI legislation is accelerating with no federal floor in sight.</p>

  <h2>Top stories</h2>

  <h3>OpenAI launches the Frontier Alliance: multi-year enterprise deployment partnerships with BCG, McKinsey, Accenture, and Capgemini</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> OpenAI announced the <strong>OpenAI Frontier Alliance</strong> on February 23, 2026, formalized through multi-year partnerships with four of the world's largest consulting firms: <strong>Boston Consulting Group (BCG)</strong>, <strong>McKinsey &amp; Co.</strong>, <strong>Accenture</strong>, and <strong>Capgemini</strong>. The Frontier Alliance is designed to help enterprise clients move beyond proof-of-concept deployments and into production-scale AI implementations using OpenAI's enterprise products, including the OpenAI Frontier AI agent platform. Each consulting firm will train certified practitioners and embed OpenAI capabilities into client engagements.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Consultants are the last mile of enterprise technology adoption. By formalizing implementation channels, OpenAI is acknowledging that model capability alone does not close enterprise deals — deployment complexity, change management, and integration with existing systems does. For product and ops teams, this raises the bar: expect more structured RFPs, more procurement scrutiny, and more competition from teams that arrive with a BCG or Accenture playbook. If you're building or buying AI tooling, understand that "consultant-ready" is increasingly a product requirement.</p>

  <h3>ChatGPT begins serving ads to Free and Go tier users — implications for enterprise and data contracts</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>OpenAI</strong> launched ads inside <strong>ChatGPT</strong> on February 9, 2026, targeting U.S. users on the Free and Go tiers. Sponsored placements from brands including <strong>Expedia</strong> and <strong>Qualcomm</strong> have been observed appearing after a user's first message. OpenAI has committed that ads do not influence model answers and that user data will not be sold. No public ad platform has been announced. By late February, analysis suggests over 800 million ChatGPT users are on ad-supported tiers.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> For enterprise teams, the headline risk is not the ads themselves — enterprise and team plans are excluded from ad-supported tiers. The deeper signal is strategic: OpenAI now has a dual revenue model (subscriptions + advertising), which changes its incentives around free-tier usage, data handling, and what gets prioritized in model improvements. Enterprises should audit which employees are using free-tier ChatGPT for work tasks (and therefore subject to ad-tier data policies), and consider whether personal device usage needs inclusion in your AI acceptable-use policy.</p>

  <h3>Samsung Galaxy AI expands multi-agent ecosystem: Perplexity AI added as selectable agent on Galaxy S26 series</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Samsung</strong> announced on February 22–23, 2026 that it is expanding the <strong>Galaxy AI</strong> ecosystem to support multiple AI agents, with <strong>Perplexity AI</strong> added as the first third-party agent integration. Perplexity's agent will be embedded across native Galaxy apps including <strong>Samsung Notes</strong>, <strong>Clock</strong>, <strong>Gallery</strong>, <strong>Reminder</strong>, and <strong>Calendar</strong>, as well as selected third-party apps. Users can invoke Perplexity using the activation phrase "Hey Plex" or by holding the side button. The integration launches with the Galaxy S26 series.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is one of the first large-scale examples of a hardware OEM building a multi-agent orchestration layer directly into a consumer device OS. It matters for enterprise product teams for two reasons: (1) it establishes a model where the operating system becomes the coordination layer for heterogeneous AI agents — a pattern likely to spread to enterprise device management; and (2) <strong>Perplexity</strong>'s positioning as a web search agent inside Samsung's stack further validates the "AI as OS-level feature" thesis that <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Copilot+ PCs</strong>, and <strong>Google Gemini Nano</strong> are also pursuing.</p>

  <h3>Anthropic releases Claude Code Security: embedded vulnerability scanning rolling out to enterprise and team customers</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Anthropic</strong> announced <strong>Claude Code Security</strong>, a capability embedded in <strong>Claude Code</strong> that automatically scans code for security vulnerabilities and suggests patching solutions. As of late February 2026, the feature is rolling out to a limited number of enterprise and team customers. Claude Code Security integrates into the existing coding workflow rather than requiring a separate scan step.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Agentic coding tools are now being used to write production code at scale. Security scanning embedded in the generation loop — rather than bolted on afterward — reduces the time-to-fix window and removes the friction that causes developers to skip manual scanning. For platform and security teams evaluating <strong>Claude Code</strong> or similar tools, this is worth tracking as a differentiator: the question is not just "does this tool write good code" but "does it also help you avoid shipping vulnerabilities."</p>

  <h2>Shipping &amp; platform updates</h2>

  <h3>GitHub Copilot coding agent gets a model picker for Business and Enterprise: admins can now select models for async background agent tasks</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>GitHub</strong> announced on February 19, 2026 that <strong>Copilot Business</strong> and <strong>Copilot Enterprise</strong> admins can now select which model powers the <strong>Copilot coding agent</strong> — GitHub's asynchronous, autonomous background agent that delegates coding tasks, opens draft pull requests, and requests reviews without synchronous developer involvement. Model selection is controlled at the organization policy level.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Autonomous coding agents introduce a new class of organizational decision: which model runs unsupervised on your codebase? Admin-level model selection means this is now explicitly a governance choice, not a developer preference. If your organization uses <strong>GitHub Copilot Business</strong> or <strong>Enterprise</strong>, this week is a good time to document your model selection policy: which tasks get which models, what cost multipliers are acceptable, and who is notified when the agent submits a PR.</p>

  <h3>Commotion launches an Enterprise AI Operating System powered by NVIDIA Nemotron open models</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Commotion</strong>, a subsidiary of <strong>Tata Communications</strong>, announced the launch of an <strong>Enterprise AI Operating System</strong> built on <strong>NVIDIA Nemotron</strong> open models. The system is positioned as a productivity platform for "digital workforces," offering enterprise-grade orchestration of AI agents at scale. The launch was announced via press release on February 23, 2026.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> "Enterprise AI OS" is becoming a recognized product category. Tata Communications' angle is connectivity + AI infrastructure bundled together — relevant for enterprises evaluating AI deployments in regulated or bandwidth-constrained markets. <strong>NVIDIA Nemotron</strong>'s inclusion signals that open-weight models are increasingly viable for enterprise production use cases where data residency, customization, or cost control is a priority over frontier model capability.</p>
  <p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.boerse.de/nachrichten/EQS-News-Commotion-Launches-Enterprise-AI-Operating-System-Powered-by-NVIDIA-Nemotron-Open-Models-to-Scale-Productivity-For-Digital-Workforces/38151736">Boerse.de / EQS — Commotion Enterprise AI OS launch</a></p>

  <h3>Gemini 3.1 Pro now available in NotebookLM for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Google DeepMind</strong> released <strong>Gemini 3.1 Pro</strong> on February 19, 2026, and confirmed availability in <strong>NotebookLM</strong> exclusively for <strong>Google AI Pro</strong> and <strong>Ultra</strong> subscribers. The model features a 1M-token context window and achieves 77.1% on ARC-AGI-2 according to Google. The rollout in <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> was also confirmed this week.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> NotebookLM's inclusion is notable for knowledge work and document analysis use cases. A 1M-token context window enables processing of very large document sets (entire policy libraries, large codebases, multi-year financial records) in a single session. For enterprise teams already using NotebookLM for research synthesis, upgrading to a Pro/Ultra plan to access Gemini 3.1 Pro is a concrete near-term evaluation worth running against your current workflow.</p>

  <h3>Anthropic releases Claude Opus 4.6 with an agent team feature and Claude in PowerPoint</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Anthropic</strong> released <strong>Claude Opus 4.6</strong> on February 5, 2026. Key additions include an <strong>agent team</strong> feature (enabling Claude to coordinate with sub-agents for complex tasks) and <strong>Claude in PowerPoint</strong> (enabling Claude-powered content generation and editing within Microsoft PowerPoint via an integration). Claude Opus 4.6 is the flagship model in Anthropic's current lineup.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> "Agent teams" as a first-class model capability — rather than something you build with custom orchestration — lowers the barrier to multi-agent architectures for product teams. The PowerPoint integration is a signal that AI is pushing further into productivity suite workflows that business users live in daily. If your org is on Microsoft 365, this is worth a controlled pilot: the question is whether agent-assisted slide generation changes the throughput or quality of your presentation workflows.</p>

  <h2>Policy, security, and governance</h2>

  <h3>Enterprise agentic AI attack surface is expanding: MCP supply chain attacks, tool poisoning, and overprivileged agents documented</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> A Help Net Security report published February 23, 2026 documented specific attack vectors emerging from enterprise <strong>Model Context Protocol (MCP)</strong> deployments, including: (1) <strong>tool poisoning</strong> — malicious tools that manipulate agent behavior when called; (2) <strong>MCP supply chain attacks</strong> — a fake npm package mimicking an email integration that silently copied outbound messages to an attacker-controlled endpoint; (3) <strong>remote code execution flaws</strong> in MCP implementations; and (4) <strong>overprivileged agent access</strong> — agents with broader tool and data access than their task requires. A separate ZDNet report cited an MIT study finding AI agents are "fast, loose, and out of control" with respect to guardrails, citing prompt injection vulnerabilities in MCP integrations and Brave Search.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> MCP has become the dominant integration standard for connecting AI agents to tools and data sources. That adoption is fast outpacing security practices. The fake npm package incident is a classic supply chain attack adapted to AI tooling — the same class of risk as the npm <code>event-stream</code> compromise in 2018, but now the payload is an agent that exfiltrates data via an LLM workflow. <strong>Immediate actions:</strong> audit every MCP server your agents connect to; implement least-privilege scoping for tool access; review your npm and dependency lock files if you build or consume open-source MCP integrations.</p>

  <h3>U.S. state AI legislation: 6th 2026 tracker update shows patchwork of private-sector obligations growing</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Troutman Pepper's Privacy + Cyber + AI practice published its sixth 2026 update tracking proposed state AI legislation affecting private-sector AI developers and deployers, dated February 23, 2026. The tracker covers bills related to transparency requirements, risk management obligations, and notice/disclosure requirements across multiple U.S. states. Separately, the Texas AI law (effective January 1, 2026) focuses on transparency and risk management for high-risk AI applications. Multiple other states — including Illinois, Utah, Connecticut, and Minnesota — have passed industry-specific AI regulations.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Without a federal AI framework, every U.S.-facing enterprise product now has a multi-state compliance matrix to manage. The pattern is emerging: <strong>high-risk AI applications</strong> (hiring, lending, healthcare, criminal justice) will face disclosure and risk management requirements in multiple states simultaneously, with different definitions, thresholds, and enforcement mechanisms. Product teams should begin building a "compliance core" — documentation, audit logs, risk assessments — that can map to state-specific requirements rather than building separate compliance programs per state.</p>

  <h3>88 countries endorse the New Delhi Declaration on AI: international consensus on responsible AI governance</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> As of February 21, 2026, 88 countries and international organizations endorsed the <strong>New Delhi Declaration on AI</strong>, a non-binding multilateral framework for responsible AI development. The declaration emphasizes inclusive AI governance, safety, and alignment between AI capabilities and human values. India's government has positioned the declaration as a Global South counterweight to U.S.- and EU-centric AI governance frameworks.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> For multinational enterprises, the proliferation of AI governance frameworks (EU AI Act, U.S. state laws, South Korea's AI Basic Act, the New Delhi Declaration) is creating a fragmented compliance landscape. The practical implication: design for the highest-friction regulatory regime your product touches, document your risk management approach in a vendor- and jurisdiction-neutral way, and monitor whether the New Delhi Declaration's signatories introduce binding domestic legislation aligned to its principles.</p>

  <h2>One take</h2>
  <p>Today's biggest story — <strong>OpenAI's Frontier Alliance</strong> — is also the clearest signal that enterprise AI has moved from a technology problem to an implementation problem. The reason Fortune 500 companies stall at pilot stage isn't that the models aren't good enough; it's that deploying AI at scale requires change management, integration architecture, data governance, and organizational redesign that consulting firms are built to provide. By institutionalizing this channel, OpenAI is essentially admitting that selling ChatGPT Enterprise licenses is not enough — the real competition is now happening at the implementation layer.</p>
  <p>At the same time, the MCP security incidents documented this week are a preview of the adversarial future: as agents gain real-world capabilities (sending email, reading files, calling APIs), the attack surface shifts from data at rest to <em>agent behavior in motion</em>. The fake npm package story is particularly instructive — it's a supply chain attack that doesn't need to compromise the model, just the tools the model is allowed to call.</p>
  <p><strong>What to do this week:</strong> (1) If your organization has active AI pilots, map which consulting firm relationships you have and understand whether they're developing OpenAI Frontier Alliance practices — that may shape future contract terms. (2) Audit your MCP server inventory and dependency tree: any third-party MCP integration should be treated with the same scrutiny as a third-party npm package in a production codebase. (3) Pull your AI acceptable-use policy and check whether it addresses employee use of free-tier ChatGPT on personal devices — that gap is now a data-governance exposure.</p>
