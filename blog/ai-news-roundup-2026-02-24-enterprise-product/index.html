  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p><strong>Anthropic</strong> made the most consequential enterprise AI move of the day, launching a full plugin system for <strong>Claude Cowork</strong> that puts pre-built agents directly inside finance, legal, HR, engineering, and design departments — with IT-grade controls for deployment. At the same time, <strong>OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap</strong> publicly acknowledged that enterprise AI still hasn't genuinely penetrated business processes at scale, even as OpenAI Frontier builds momentum. The legal stakes just got higher too: a U.S. federal court ruled that <strong>AI-generated documents are not protected by attorney-client privilege</strong>, a ruling that has immediate implications for how legal and compliance teams use consumer AI tools on sensitive work.</p>

  <h2>Top stories</h2>

  <h3>Anthropic launches Claude Cowork enterprise plugin system: pre-built agents for finance, legal, HR, and engineering</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> On February 24, 2026, <strong>Anthropic</strong> launched a major expansion of its <strong>Claude Cowork</strong> enterprise platform, introducing a plugin system that lets organizations deploy pre-built AI agents into department-specific workflows. Out-of-the-box plugins at launch target finance (financial research and analysis), legal, HR (human resources), engineering (specification and code review), and design. Admins can deploy these through a private, company-controlled software marketplace with centralized configuration and data-flow controls. Starting today, companies can link <strong>Claude Cowork</strong> directly to external systems including <strong>Google Drive</strong>, <strong>Gmail</strong>, <strong>DocuSign</strong>, <strong>FactSet</strong>, <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft PowerPoint</strong>. Anthropic described the launch as a response to 2025's failed agent rollouts: "2025 was meant to be the year agents transformed the enterprise, but the hype turned out to be mostly premature. It wasn't a failure of effort. It was a failure of approach," said Anthropic's head of Americas, Kate Jensen.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This is the most operationally credible enterprise agent deployment system any frontier AI lab has shipped to date. The critical differentiator is not the plugins themselves — it's the IT-grade control layer. Admins get centralized marketplace control, defined data flows, and customizable plugin configurations. This is the architecture that has blocked enterprise agent adoption since 2024: "we can't let AI agents run loose on sensitive data without knowing what they can access." For product and IT teams evaluating AI deployments, Claude Cowork's plugin architecture is now the reference point for what "enterprise-ready agent deployment" actually looks like. Expect <strong>OpenAI Frontier</strong> and <strong>Microsoft Copilot</strong> to respond with similar control surfaces within the next 30–60 days.</p>

  <h3>OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap: "We have not yet really seen AI penetrate enterprise business processes"</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> Speaking at the <strong>India AI Impact Summit</strong> in New Delhi on February 24, 2026, <strong>OpenAI COO Brad Lightcap</strong> made a candid admission: enterprises have powerful AI tools available, but broad-based penetration into actual business processes hasn't happened. "You've got really powerful AI systems that any person can use in their individual capacity. And enterprises are these highly complex organizations with a lot of people, teams, all having to work together, a lot of context. There are very complex goals that have to be achieved using a lot of different systems and tools," Lightcap said. He cited this gap as direct motivation behind the <strong>OpenAI Frontier</strong> platform, launched earlier in February, and the subsequent <strong>OpenAI Frontier Alliance</strong> consulting partnerships with <strong>BCG</strong>, <strong>McKinsey</strong>, <strong>Accenture</strong>, and <strong>Capgemini</strong>. Meanwhile, <strong>OpenAI</strong> ended 2025 with over $20 billion in annualized revenue, per CFO Sarah Friar's January post.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> When a COO of a frontier AI lab publicly acknowledges the enterprise gap, it should recalibrate internal roadmaps. The "AI isn't penetrating business processes" framing is specifically about workflows, not tools — it's the difference between employees using ChatGPT ad-hoc and AI actually running finance reconciliation, HR onboarding, or procurement approval chains. If OpenAI can't yet point to widespread process-level adoption despite dominant market presence, that's a signal that any enterprise team claiming "we've adopted AI" should audit whether they mean tool access or actual workflow transformation.</p>

  <h3>Cursor announces major update: background agents run in parallel on isolated VMs, triggerable from Slack and GitHub</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Cursor</strong> announced significant updates to its AI coding agents on February 24, 2026. The flagship change: agents now run in fully isolated virtual machines in the cloud, allowing 10–20 background agent tasks to execute in parallel without competing for local developer machine resources. Each agent can record its work through videos, logs, and screenshots. Agents are now triggerable from the web, Cursor's desktop app, mobile, <strong>Slack</strong>, and <strong>Microsoft GitHub</strong>. <strong>BugBot</strong>, Cursor's automated PR review tool, received updates enabling back-and-forth conversational replies for context clarification. "Instead of having one to three things that you're doing at once, you can have 10 or 20 of these things running," said Alexi Robbins, Cursor's co-head of engineering for asynchronous agents. Cursor's valuation currently sits at $29.3 billion, with over $1 billion in annualized revenue reported in November 2025.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Isolated VMs for parallel agent execution solves a real constraint that has kept AI coding agents from scaling in practice: resource contention and environment pollution. When 10 agents can run concurrently on ephemeral cloud machines, the economics of AI-assisted development change — a single senior developer can supervise a high-throughput pipeline of agent-generated PRs rather than waiting sequentially. The Slack trigger is significant for enterprise teams: it means non-developer stakeholders (product managers, QA, security teams) can now initiate coded tasks without touching an IDE. Evaluate BugBot's conversational replies as a potential replacement for synchronous code review cycles.</p>

  <h3>Workday reports FY2026 full-year results: $9.55 billion revenue (+13.1% YoY), doubles down on "enterprise AI platform" positioning</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ: WDAY)</strong> reported fiscal year 2026 full-year results on February 24, 2026. Full-year total revenues reached $9.552 billion, up 13.1% year-over-year. Subscription revenues hit $8.833 billion (+14.5% YoY). Q4 total revenues were $2.532 billion (+14.5% YoY). Non-GAAP operating income for Q4 was $774 million (30.6% margin), up from $584 million (26.4%) in the prior year. Workday explicitly describes itself as "the enterprise AI platform for managing people, money, and agents" — a deliberate rebranding that places agentic AI at the core of its product identity.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Workday's addition of "and agents" to its identity statement is not marketing; it reflects a product reality where AI agents are increasingly embedded in HCM (Human Capital Management) and financial management workflows for large enterprises. With $9.55 billion in revenue and accelerating margins, Workday has the resources to build and acquire agent capabilities that will shape how enterprises think about HR and finance automation. For enterprise buyers evaluating AI investments in the HCM or ERP space, Workday's Q4 margin expansion suggests the "AI as cost center" narrative is shifting — the platform is extracting more value from existing customers as agent features roll out.</p>

  <h2>Shipping &amp; platform updates</h2>

  <h3>Collate launches Semantic Intelligence Graph: structured enterprise knowledge for AI agents and workflows</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Collate, Inc.</strong> launched the <strong>Semantic Intelligence Graph</strong> on February 24, 2026. The product gives AI agents a structured semantic understanding of enterprise data — mapping relationships, definitions, and business context that raw data schemas don't capture. It is designed to plug into existing AI agent workflows and enable more accurate, context-aware responses when agents query enterprise data sources.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI agents fail in enterprise contexts not because models are too weak but because they lack organizational context: what does "ARR" mean in this company's data model? What's the relationship between Product Line A and Cost Center 47? The Semantic Intelligence Graph is an attempt to solve the "shared vocabulary" problem between AI agents and enterprise data. Evaluate it if your AI workflows are producing confidently wrong answers because agents are misinterpreting internal data semantics.</p>
  <p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/24/3243453/0/en/Collate-Launches-Semantic-Intelligence-Graph-to-Help-AI-Understand-Enterprise-Data.html">GlobeNewswire — Collate Semantic Intelligence Graph launch</a></p>

  <h3>Quarrio launches Deterministic AI Platform: accuracy-first infrastructure for post-GenAI enterprise execution</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Quarrio</strong> launched its <strong>Deterministic AI Platform</strong> on February 24, 2026, positioning it as infrastructure for a "post-GenAI era." The platform is designed for enterprise use cases where accuracy is non-negotiable — financial calculations, compliance checks, legal document processing — and where probabilistic generative AI outputs are insufficiently reliable. Quarrio argues that enterprises have "poured billions into generative AI with limited measurable return" and that deterministic execution is the next phase.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The "deterministic vs. probabilistic" framing is gaining traction as enterprises hit the limits of LLM hallucination in high-stakes workflows. Finance, healthcare, and legal teams running AI on regulatory documents can't accept a 3% error rate that would be acceptable in a customer support chatbot. Quarrio's positioning reflects a real market gap, though claims should be evaluated against specific use case requirements. If your AI roadmap includes compliance-critical automation, this category deserves a place on your vendor evaluation list.</p>

  <h3>Microsoft Security Copilot: real-world governance and licensing lessons from enterprise deployments</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> VOSS Solutions published a February 24, 2026 case study documenting real-world findings from enabling <strong>Microsoft Security Copilot</strong> in enterprise environments. Key finding: enabling Security Copilot on a relatively small Microsoft tenant — even with an E5 license — generated thousands of dollars in unexpected charges within under a month, while producing limited actionable security output. VOSS attributed this to insufficient pre-deployment governance planning around consumption-based billing and use-case scoping.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Microsoft Security Copilot uses a consumption billing model (Security Compute Units, or SCUs) on top of existing Microsoft 365 licensing. Many enterprise IT teams are enabling it under the assumption that E5 licensing covers usage — it doesn't. The unexpected cost pattern documented by VOSS is not unique; it mirrors similar surprise bills reported with <strong>GitHub Copilot</strong> and <strong>Azure OpenAI Service</strong> when consumption models are deployed without cost guardrails. Before enabling Security Copilot, set explicit SCU caps, define which security workflows justify the per-query cost, and build a review checkpoint at 30 days.</p>

  <h3>Google AI Mode expands to eCommerce: Gemini-powered agentic checkout now live in Search</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> <strong>Google</strong> expanded its <strong>AI Mode</strong> in Search to include agentic eCommerce capabilities, including a feature called <strong>Agentic Checkout</strong> that enables customers to complete purchases directly within the AI interface without switching to external merchant websites. The expansion is powered by <strong>Google Gemini</strong> and targets the product discovery and purchasing workflow. The feature is rolling out to Google Search users in the United States.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Agentic checkout inside Google Search represents a structural shift in eCommerce discovery: if consumers complete purchases inside Google's AI interface, product page traffic to merchant sites may decline even as overall purchase volume holds. For enterprise product and marketing teams with eCommerce exposure, this is worth monitoring as a near-term traffic pattern change. It also signals that Google views Gemini as the transaction layer of Search, not just the answer layer.</p>

  <h2>Policy, security, and governance</h2>

  <h3>Federal court rules AI-generated documents are NOT protected by attorney-client privilege</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff (Southern District of New York) ruled on February 24, 2026 that approximately 31 documents generated by defendant Bradley Heppner using a publicly available consumer AI platform are <strong>not protected by attorney-client privilege or the work product doctrine</strong>. Heppner had independently used a consumer-grade generative AI platform to draft legal defense strategies and arguments after learning he was under federal investigation (Heppner was indicted on October 28, 2025 on charges including securities fraud and wire fraud). The court found that use of a consumer AI tool compromised confidentiality and failed to meet the requirements for privilege protection, since the documents were not generated under attorney direction and were processed through an external third-party platform.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This ruling has immediate, direct implications for any enterprise legal, compliance, or HR team using consumer AI tools — ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Gemini, Copilot on personal accounts — to draft legal strategies, responses to regulatory inquiries, or internal investigation documents. The confidentiality element of attorney-client privilege requires that communication remain between attorney and client; routing it through a third-party AI platform may break that chain. <strong>Immediate actions:</strong> (1) Audit which AI tools your legal and compliance teams are using for sensitive drafting; (2) Determine whether your AI vendor contracts include attorney-client-privilege-compatible data processing agreements; (3) If your organization has enterprise AI contracts with data isolation (e.g., Microsoft Copilot with E5 DPAs, or Claude Enterprise with contractual data controls), document that configuration explicitly in your privilege framework.</p>

  <h3>OpenAI defeats xAI trade secrets lawsuit: federal judge dismisses Elon Musk's X.AI Corp case over employee poaching and code theft</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> A federal judge dismissed <strong>X.AI Corp.'s</strong> (Elon Musk's AI company) lawsuit against <strong>OpenAI</strong> on February 24, 2026. X.AI had accused OpenAI of misappropriating trade secrets by recruiting multiple former xAI employees and encouraging them to steal confidential information and code. The court found X.AI's claims insufficient to survive OpenAI's motion to dismiss.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> AI talent competition between frontier labs is a defining feature of the current market. The dismissal means OpenAI faces no near-term legal constraints on continued aggressive hiring from competitors. For enterprise legal and HR teams, the case serves as a reminder: trade secret protection for AI work product (training data, evaluation benchmarks, fine-tuning approaches) requires proactive NDA and IP assignment hygiene — litigation alone is an unreliable enforcement mechanism when engineers cross company lines with knowledge that's hard to separate from their expertise.</p>

  <h3>Agentic AI compliance gap: enterprise deployments outpacing governance frameworks for evolving regulations</h3>
  <p><strong>What happened:</strong> A February 24, 2026 Security Boulevard analysis examined the compliance adaptability of agentic AI systems against evolving regulatory frameworks including the <strong>EU AI Act</strong>, <strong>Texas AI Law</strong> (effective January 1, 2026), and emerging U.S. state-level AI obligations. The analysis found that most enterprise agentic AI deployments lack the audit trail depth, access control granularity, and human-oversight documentation that high-risk AI classifications now require in multiple jurisdictions. Separately, Redpanda's <strong>Agentic Data Plane (ADP)</strong> — announced last week — has emerged as one of the first vendor offerings explicitly designed to provide governance, observability, and unified authentication for agent-to-data connections at enterprise scale.</p>
  <p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> The regulatory clock is ahead of most enterprise AI governance programs. The Texas AI Law is already live; EU AI Act obligations for high-risk AI systems are in force. If your organization is deploying AI agents in HR decisions (hiring, performance review), lending, insurance underwriting, or healthcare workflows, you are likely operating a "high-risk AI system" under one or more active regulatory frameworks right now. The compliance gap isn't theoretical. Build your audit trail, access logs, and human-oversight documentation now — retrofitting them into a live production agent system is significantly harder than designing them in from day one.</p>

  <h2>One take</h2>
  <p>Today's two biggest stories — <strong>Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugin launch</strong> and the <strong>attorney-client privilege ruling</strong> — arrive on the same day for a reason: enterprise AI is entering a phase where deployment maturity and legal accountability are developing simultaneously, and the gap between them is where the risk lives.</p>
  <p>Anthropic's plugin architecture is genuinely significant because it addresses the failure mode that killed 2025's "year of enterprise agents" narrative: agents without IT controls are agents nobody deploys in production. The new system gives admins centralized control over what agents can access, what they can do, and how they're scoped — the same governance surface that enterprise software has required for 20 years. This is the unlock.</p>
  <p>But the attorney-client privilege ruling is a reminder that "enterprise-grade deployment" and "legally safe use" are not the same thing. Even on an enterprise plan, if sensitive legal strategy is being drafted with AI assistance, the privilege analysis now requires careful review of how the tool processes and stores that data. The Judge Rakoff ruling is the first high-profile case; it will not be the last.</p>
  <p><strong>What to do this week:</strong> (1) If you're evaluating <strong>Claude Cowork</strong>, request an enterprise plugin sandbox and map a single high-value department workflow (finance reconciliation, HR onboarding screening) through the plugin architecture before committing to broader rollout. (2) Pull your AI acceptable-use policy and add an explicit section on legal and compliance work product — which tools are approved for drafting documents that could be subject to privilege, and which are not. (3) Check your AI agent governance documentation for audit trail coverage: if regulators asked to see how a specific agent decision was made, could you produce that record today?</p>
